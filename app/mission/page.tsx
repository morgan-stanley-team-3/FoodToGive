            Our mission is to eradicate hunger and minimize food waste by
            ensuring that excess food reaches those who need it most. We believe
            in a sustainable future where no one in Singapore goes hungry.
            Through innovation, collaboration, and dedication, we are committed
            to building a community where food is shared with dignity, care, and
            compassion.
